# Computer-Assistant-Agent
It's a final project of biomedical Engineering lesson.  
In this project, we tried to help people with disabilities 
to have a comfortable experience in using computer. 
By using face-recognition and speech-recognition, 
we made all the tasks on the computer possible by tracking facial motionand speech. 
Even playing games is possible.
